# Pyber

An analysis of all rides booked with the new ride-sharing company, Pyber. The dataset used contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

Matplotlib was used to create a bubble plot that showcases the relationship between four key variables:
* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

As well as three pie charts displaying:
* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type

### Data Sources:
* [City Data](Resources/city_data.csv)
* [Ride Data](Resources/ride_data.csv)

### Prerequisites:
* Python
* Jupyter notebook
* Matplotlib.pyplot
